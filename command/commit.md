Create a git commit for the staged changes in this project. Follow these steps:

1. Review the staged changes using git diff --cached
2. Analyze the changes to understand what was modified
3. Write a clear, concise commit message that:
   - Focuses on WHY the changes were made, not just WHAT changed
   - Uses imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Is specific and meaningful (avoid generic messages like "Update" or "Fix")
   - Follows the repository's existing commit message style
4. Create the commit with the staged changes

If there are no staged changes, let me know and do not create an empty commit.
