Analyze the documentation in {{DIRECTORY_PATH}} to identify any gaps that would prevent an AI agent from successfully implementing the task/story.

Provide a comprehensive gap analysis with:
1. Documentation inventory
2. Readiness assessment
3. Critical and high-priority gaps
4. Actionable recommendations

Focus on information an AI agent would need for a successful first pass implementation.
